## What Am I Up to Currently?
I’ve been working on my AOSP-based custom ROM project called [Halcyon](https://github.com/halcyonproject). Currently, I am focusing on its new major update based on the latest Android 15, which was released on September 4th. Most things are working just fine; however, there are still some minor issues occurring, and some more UI work is needed.
